These CPU Ray-Tracer project was created as my own goal to obtain knowlegde and understanding of basic concept related to computer graphics, as well as to gain more understanding of OOP. The project was intended to not relly on any external libraries like glm.

Main bases of information was Piter Shirley book: "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf, as well as materials created by Scratchapixel: https://www.scratchapixel.com/index.html. 

As such all my codeis also available under the Fair Use terms. I also encourage you to contact me in case of any questions, comments and suggestions. All feedback, especially concerning any programming habbits, tips or messages of concern regarding some of proposed solutions are welcome. 

The proposed solution is under no term finished, as numerous new things may be implemented. These includes such concepts as:
- implementing materials with scatter funcion [DO it now!!!]
- movable and rotatable camera that was under development but for now was scrapted due to poor results.
- implementing real path-tracing algorithm.
- implementation of differnet lighting model.
- possible changes to the way reflective and refractive materials have been implemented.
- adding and testing emissive property in Phong model as it wasn't properly implemented, used and tested yet.
- Accelerating structures.
- Triangle and triangle meshes. 
- loading meshes and their material properties from obj or other files format.
- Writing to different file type, e.g. png, jpg.

As such the current phase of project will serve as my base for further getting knowledge in computer graphics.
